Hey Yuhang (Chinese: 张宇航) here! Welcome to my personal website.


The motto I practice in my life: Work hard and play hard. Experience new things. Cherish friends. Stay true to principles. Live passionately and fully and well. Love and be loved if at all possible.


I'm currently studying as a fourth-year PhD Student in State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University. 

My research interest includes:
- Uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulations.
- Hydrological ensemble forecasting, pre-processing and post-processing.
- Hydrological and meteorological extreme events.

Hey Yuhang (Chinese: 张宇航) here! Welcome to my personal website. The motto I practice in my life: Work hard and play hard. Stay true to principles. Experience new things. Live passionately, fully, and well. Love and be loved if at all possible.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Infrastructure Engineering at the University of Melbourne, collaborating closely with Professor QJ Wang and others. With a primary focus on precipitation forecasting and reanalysis, My research interests lie in utilizing advanced statistical models to enhance the accuracy and reliability of various precipitation products.

Before joining the University of Melbourne, I completed my PhD in Physical Geography at the Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, China. During PhD study, I focused on the evaluation, application and quality improvement of global satellite precipitation estimates products. I also utilized statistical models to pre-processing and post-processing hydrological simulations.

I look forward to communicating and collaborating with different people. 

My research interest includes:
- Uncertainty analysis of hydrological simulations.
- Hydrological ensemble forecasting, pre-processing and post-processing.
- Satellite precipitation estimates products: evaluation, application and imporvement.
- Hydrological and meteorological extreme events.
- Machine learning and deep learning.

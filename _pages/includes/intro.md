Hey Yuhang (Chinese:张宇航) here! I'm currently studying as a forth-year PhD Student in State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University. My research interest includes satellite precipitation, hydrology, climate and deep learning. Feel free to email me at [zhangyh19@mail.bnu.edu.cn](mailto:zhangyh19@mail.bnu.edu.cn). 

The motto I practice in my life and work is as follows.

Work hard and play hard. Eat sensibly. Write beautifully. Experience new things. Cherish friends, stay true to principles, live passionately and fully and well. Love and be loved if at all possible.
